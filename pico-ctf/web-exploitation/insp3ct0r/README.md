## Description

Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/44924/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:44924

## Solution

The website is serving 3 files, the `index.html` with the 1st part of the flag as comment `picoCTF{tru3_d3`, the `mycss.css` file with the 2nd part of the flag as comment `t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t` and the `myjs.js` file with the 3rd part of the flag `_lucky?f10be399}`. The entire flag is `picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?f10be399}`
