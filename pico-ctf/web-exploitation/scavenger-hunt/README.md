# Scavenger Hunt

[Scavenger Hunt](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/161)

## Description

There is some interesting information hidden around this site http://mercury.picoctf.net:39491/. Can you find it?

## Solution

My initial instinct was to open the console in browser, and then I looked into
the sources. I found the first part of the flag in the HTML file `picoCTF{t`.

Almost missed the flag in the CSS file `h4ts_4_l0`. Then I was thinking that
maybe there is a cookie or header that has some part of the flag.

I am surprised at this point that JS doesn't have the rest of the flag or something.

However there is a comment.
/* How can I keep Google from indexing my website? */
I searched it on Google, and this made me think that maybe I can try to see if there is any /robots.txt path.
And there is one with the 3rd part of the flag `t_0f_pl4c`.

Next "I think this is an apache server... can you Access the next flag?"

Hmmm. Is .htaccess a path for apache? idk I just found some random stuff and it worked.
And for the 4th part we have `3s_2_lO0k`.

Then the author said something about Mac. So I can try to see if there is a .DS_Store path in the url.
For the 5th part of the flag I found `_f7ce8828`

Finally the entire flag is `picoCTF{th4ts_4_l0t_0f_pl4c3s_2_lO0k_f7ce8828}`.
